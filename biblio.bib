	abstract = { Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm mostly resolves the redundancy at the velocity level. In this paper we extend the CLIK algorithm to the acceleration level to meet some applications that require the joint accelerations. The redundancy resolutions at the velocities and acceleration levels via pseudoinverse method are analyzed respectively. The objective function of joint limits avoidance(JLA) is combined into the redundancy resolution as an optimization approach of the null space motion. A seven-DOF redundant manipulator is designed to do the computer simulations and the real experiments are carried out on a Powercube modular manipulator. Their results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. }

abstract = {We studied ladder climbing locomotion with the humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO, under the constraints suggested by DARPA. Considering the hardware constraints of the robot platform, we planned for the robot to climb backward with four limbs moving separately. Task-priority whole-body inverse kinematics was used to generate and track the motion while maintaining COM inside the support polygon. As ladder climbing is a multicontact motion that generates interaction and internal forces, we resolved these issues using a gain overriding method applied to the position control of the motor controllers. This paper also provides various vision methods and posture modification strategies for the restricted conditions of the challenge. We ultimately verified our work in the DRC trials by getting a full score on the ladder task.},

ABSTRACT={This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.}}

The robot has generalized limbs and hands capable of mobility and manipulation, along with almost fully hemispherical three-dimensional sensing with passive stereo cameras. The system is semiautonomous, enabling low-bandwidth, high latency control operated from a standard laptop. Because limbs are used for mobility and manipulation, a single unified mobile manipulation planner is used to generate autonomous behaviors, including walking, sitting, climbing, grasping, and manipulating. The remote operator interface is optimized to designate, parametrize, sequence, and preview behaviors, which are then executed by the robot. RoboSimian placed fifth in the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials, demonstrating its ability to perform disaster recovery tasks in degraded human environments.},

	abstract = {In December 2013, 16 teams from around the world gathered at Homestead Speedway near Miami, FL to participate in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials, an aggressive robotics competition partly inspired by the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi reactor incident. While the focus of the DRC Trials is to advance robotics for use in austere and inhospitable environments, the objectives of the DRC are to progress the areas of supervised autonomy and mobile manipulation for everyday robotics. NASA's Johnson Space Center led a team comprised of numerous partners to develop Valkyrie, NASA's first bipedal humanoid robot. Valkyrie is a 44 degree-of-freedom, series elastic actuator-based robot that draws upon over 18 years of humanoid robotics design heritage. Valkyrie's application intent is aimed at not only responding to events like Fukushima, but also advancing human spaceflight endeavors in extraterrestrial planetary settings. This paper presents a brief system overview, detailing Valkyrie's mechatronic subsystems, followed by a summarization of the inverse kinematics-based walking algorithm employed at the Trials. Next, the software and control architectures are highlighted along with a description of the operator interface tools. Finally, some closing remarks are given about the competition, and a vision of future work is provided.},

The primary goal of the DRC is to develop robots capable of assisting humans in responding to natural and manmade disasters. The robots are expected to use standard tools and equipment to accomplish the mission. The DRC Trials consisted of eight different challenges that tested robot mobility, manipulation, and control under degraded communications and time constraints. Team IHMC competed using the Atlas humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics. We competed against 16 international teams and placed second in the competition. This article discusses the challenges we faced in transitioning from simulation to hardware. It also discusses the lessons learned both during the competition and in the months of preparation leading up to it. The lessons address the value of reliable hardware and solid software practices. They also cover effective approaches to bipedal walking and designing for human-robot teamwork. Lastly, the lessons present a philosophical discussion about choices related to designing robotic systems.},

	abstract="This chapter has a tutorial nature in introducing a number of useful concepts which resulted by reasoning with power ports rather than with signals, as people usually do in control. Arjan is one of the Godfathers in this way of thinking and he has been a pioneer in bringing these concepts to a new level, introducing proper geometry, a sound system theoretic basis and divulgating these issues. This chapter shows how, by using these concepts, it is possible to address or solve certain problems in robotics, control and passivity in a simple and straightforward way. It also presents a formal proof of a claim which is often used as a conjecture and which gives theoretical arguments to counteract the statement which is often used against passivity and saying that passivity is too restrictive and stability is what should be looked for. Many of the concepts reported in the chapter have been the results of discussions with Arjan or are still issues that I am working on with Arjan. It is a great pleasure and honour to have the opportunity to contribute in this way to a recognition of the incredible career of a college and friend for which I have incredible respect from an intellectual and personal point of view.",

The proposed method guarantees strict priority among different groups of tasks such as safety-related, operational and optimization tasks. Moreover, a soft priority measure in the form of penalty parameters can be employed to prioritize tasks at the same priority level. As opposed to kinematic control schemes, the proposed framework is a holistic approach to control of redundant robotic systems, which solves the redundancy resolution, dynamic control and control allocation problems simultaneously. Numerical simulations of a hyper-redundant articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is presented to validate the proposed framework.}}

	abstract="This paper presents the first steps toward unifying locomotion controllers and algorithms with whole-body control and manipulation. A theoretical framework for this unification will be given based upon quadratic programs utilizing control Lyapunov functions. In particular, we will first consider output based feedback linearization strategies for locomotion together with whole-body control methods for manipulation. We will show that these two traditionally disjoint methods are equivalent through the correct choice of controller. We will then present a method for unifying these two methodologies through the use of control Lyapunov functions presented in the form of a quadratic program. In addition, it will be shown that these controllers can be combined with force-based control to achieve locomotion and force-based manipulation in a single framework. Finally, simulation results will be presented demonstrating the validity of the proposed framework.",

	abstract = {Purpose - The paper seeks to present a new generation of torque-controlled light-weight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center.Design methodology approach - An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented. Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor redundancy and passivity-based control. In the DLR root concept, joint torque sensing plays a central role.Findings - In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level.Practical implications - The DLR robots are excellent research platforms for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant). The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first arms on the market in the near future.Originality value - This paper introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation in human environments. To the best of one's knowledge, the first systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot-human crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

	abstract = { This paper describes a general passivity-based framework for the control of flexible joint robots. Recent results on torque, position, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity-based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in earlier work on torque and position control, can also be used for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential energy shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles. All the presented controllers were experimentally evaluated on DLR lightweight robots and their performance and robustness shown with respect to uncertain model parameters. Experimental results with position controllers as well as an impact experiment are presented briefly, and an overview of several applications is given in which the controllers have been applied. }

The Finals required a robotic platform that was robust and reliable in both hardware and software to complete tasks in 60 min under degraded communication. With this point of view, Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV integrated methods and algorithms previously verified, validated, and widely used in the robotics community. For the communication aspect, a common shared memory approach that the team adopted to enable efficient data communication under the DARPA controlled network is described. A new perception head design (optimized for the tasks of the Finals) and its data processing are then presented. In the motion planning and control aspect, various techniques, such as wheel-driven navigation, zero-moment-point (ZMP) -based locomotion, and position-based manipulation and controls, are described in this paper. By introducing strategically critical elements and key lessons learned from DRC-Trials 2013 and the testbed of Charleston, we also illustrate how DRC-Hubo has evolved successfully toward the DRC-Finals.},

To imitate the Fukushima nuclear disaster situation, the DRC performed eight tasks and degraded communication conditions. This competition demanded various robotic technologies, such as manipulation, mobility, telemetry, autonomy, and localization. Their systematic integration and the overall system robustness were also important issues in completing the challenge. In this sense, this paper presents a hardware and software system for the DRC-HUBO+, a humanoid robot that was used for the DRC; it also presents control methods, such as inverse kinematics, compliance control, a walking algorithm, and a vision algorithm, all of which were implemented to accomplish the tasks. The strategies and operations for each task are briefly explained with vision algorithms. This paper summarizes what we learned from the DRC before the conclusion. In the competition, 25 international teams participated with their various robot platforms. We competed in this challenge using the DRC-HUBO+ and won first place in the competition.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the actuator-level control of Valkyrie, a new humanoid robot designed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in collaboration with several external partners. Several topics pertaining to Valkyrie's series elastic actuators are presented including control architecture, controller design, and implementation in hardware. A decentralized approach is taken in controlling Valkyrie's many series elastic degrees of freedom. By conceptually decoupling actuator dynamics from robot limb dynamics, the problem of controlling a highly complex system is simplified and the controller development process is streamlined compared to other approaches. This hierarchical control abstraction is realized by leveraging disturbance observers in the robot's joint-level torque controllers. A novel analysis technique is applied to understand the ability of a disturbance observer to attenuate the effects of unmodeled dynamics. The performance of this control approach is demonstrated in two ways. First, torque tracking performance of a single Valkyrie actuator is characterized in terms of controllable torque resolution, tracking error, bandwidth, and power consumption. Second, tests are performed on Valkyrie's arm, a serial chain of actuators, to demonstrate the robot's ability to accurately track torques with the presented decentralized control approach.},

The reader will find in the annex a table synthesizing the characteristics of the most relevant humanoid robots. Without focusing on a specific application we consider two main classes of humanoid robots: the ones dedicated to industrial application and the ones dedicated to human-robot interaction. The technical aspects are described in a way which illustrates the humanoid robots bridging the gap between these two classes.

	abstract = {Summary This chapter presents the results regarding the unification of redundancy resolution of robot manipulators via quadratic programming (QP). The presented QP formulation is general in the sense that it incorporates equality, inequality, and bound constraints simultaneously. This QP formulation covers the online avoidance of joint physical limits and environmental obstacles, as well as the optimization of various performance indices. Every term is endowed with clear physical meaning and utility. Motivated by the real-time solution to such robotic problems, some QP online solutions are briefly reviewed. That is, traditional QP optimization routines, compact QP method, dual neural network as a QP solution, linear variational inequality (LVI)-aided primal-dual neural network (LVIAPDNN) as a QP solution, and two numerical algorithms E47 and 94LVI. Note that the presented LVIAPDNN has simple piecewise-linear dynamics, does not entail real-time matrix inversion, and can also provide joint-acceleration information for manipulator torque control in the velocity-level redundancy-resolution schemes. The QP-based unification of robots' redundancy resolution is substantiated by a large number of computer simulation results based on PUMA560, PA10, and planar robot manipulators.}}

	abstract = {Standing is a fundamental skill mastered by humans and animals alike. Although easy for adults, it requires careful and deliberate manipulation of contact forces. The variation in contact configuration (e.g., standing on one foot, on uneven ground, or while holding on for support) presents a difficult challenge for interactive simulation of humans and animals, especially while performing tasks in the presence of external disturbances. We describe an analytic approach for control of standing in three-dimensional simulations based upon local optimization. At any point in time, the control system solves a quadratic program to compute actuation by maximizing the performance of multiple motion objectives subject to constraints imposed by actuation limits and contact configuration. This formulation is suitable for interactive animation and it adapts to the proportions of any character model in any non-planar, frictional contact configuration.},

  	abstract = {Bipedal robotic running remains a challenging benchmark in the field of control and robotics because of its highly dynamic nature and necessarily underactuated hybrid dynamics. Previous results have achieved bipedal running experimentally with a combination of theoretical results and heuristic application thereof. In particular, formal analysis of the hybrid system stability is given based on a theoretical model, but due to the gap between theoretical concepts and experimental reality, extensive tuning is necessary to achieve experimental success. In this paper, we present a formal approach to bridge this gap, starting from theoretical gait generation to a provably stable control implementation, resulting in bipedal robotic running. We first use a large-scale optimization to generate an energy-efficient running gait, subject to hybrid zero dynamics conditions and feasibility constraints which incorporate practical limitations of the robot model based on physical conditions. The stability of the gait is formally guaranteed in the hybrid system model with an input to state stability (ISS) based control law. This implementation improves the stability under practical control limitations of the system. Finally, the methodology is experimentally realized on the planar spring-legged bipedal robot, DURUS-2D, resulting in sustainable running at 1.75m/s. The paper, therefore, presents a formal method that takes the first step toward bridging the gap between theory and experiment.},

 	abstract = {This paper briefly presents the process of formally achieving bipedal robotic walking through controller synthesis inspired by human locomotion. Motivated by the hierarchical control present in humans, we begin by viewing the human as a "black box" and describe outputs, or virtual constraints, that appear to characterize human walking. By considering the equivalent outputs for the bipedal robot, a nonlinear controller can be constructed that drives the outputs of the robot to the outputs of the human; moreover, the parameters of this controller can be optimized so that stable robotic walking is provably achieved while simultaneously producing outputs of the robot that are as close as possible to those of a human. Finally, considering a control Lyapunov function based representation of these outputs allows for the class of controllers that provably achieve stable robotic walking can be greatly enlarged. The end result is the generation of bipedal robotic walking that is remarkably human-like and is experimentally realizable, as evidenced by the implementation of the resulting controllers on multiple robotic platforms.},

 	abstract = {Barrier functions (also called certificates) have been an important tool for the verification of hybrid systems, and have also played important roles in optimization and multi-objective control. The extension of a barrier function to a controlled system results in a control barrier function. This can be thought of as being analogous to how Sontag extended Lyapunov functions to control Lypaunov functions in order to enable controller synthesis for stabilization tasks. A control barrier function enables controller synthesis for safety requirements specified by forward invariance of a set using a Lyapunov-like condition. This paper develops several important extensions to the notion of a control barrier function. The first involves robustness under perturbations to the vector field defining the system. Input-to-State stability conditions are given that provide for forward invariance, when disturbances are present, of a “relaxation” of set rendered invariant without disturbances. A control barrier function can be combined with a control Lyapunov function in a quadratic program to achieve a control objective subject to safety guarantees. The second result of the paper gives conditions for the control law obtained by solving the quadratic program to be Lipschitz continuous and therefore to gives rise to well-defined solutions of the resulting closed-loop system.}}

 	abstract = { Dexterous manipulation with a highly redundant movement system is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors. }}

 	ABSTRACT={Quadruped robots require compliance to handle unexpected external forces, such as impulsive contact forces from rough terrain, or from physical human-robot interaction. This paper presents a locomotion controller using Cartesian impedance control to coordinate tracking performance and desired compliance, along with Quadratic Programming (QP) to satisfy friction cone constraints, unilateral constraints, and torque limits. First, we resort to projected inverse-dynamics to derive an analytical control law of Cartesian impedance control for constrained and underactuated systems (typically a quadruped robot). Second, we formulate a QP to compute the optimal torques that are as close as possible to the desired values resulting from Cartesian impedance control while satisfying all of the physical constraints. When the desired motion torques lead to violation of physical constraints, the QP will result in a trade-off solution that sacrifices motion performance to ensure physical constraints. The proposed algorithm gives us more insight into the system that benefits from an analytical derivation and more efficient computation compared to hierarchical QP (HQP) controllers that typically require a solution of three QPs or more. Experiments applied on the ANYmal robot with various challenging terrains show the efficiency and performance of our controller.}}

 	abstract = {Quadratic Programming (QP) has been used to combine Control Lyapunov and Control Barrier Functions (CLF and CBF) to design controllers for nonlinear systems with constraints. It has been successfully applied to robotic and automotive systems. The approach could be considered an extension of the CLF-based point-wise minimum norm controller. In this paper we modify the original QP problem in a way that guarantees that V̇<0, if the barrier constraint is inactive, as well as local asymptotic stability under the standard (minimal) assumptions on the CLF and CBF. We also remove the assumption that the CBF has uniform relative degree one. The two design parameters of the new QP setup allow us to control how aggressive the resulting control law is when trying to satisfy the two control objectives. The paper presents the controller in a closed form making it unnecessary to solve the QP problem on line and facilitating the analysis. Next, we introduce the concept of Robust-CBF that, when combined with existing ISS-CLFs, produces controllers for constrained nonlinear systems with disturbances. In an example, a nonlinear system is used to illustrate the ease with which the proposed design method handles non-convex constraints and disturbances and to illuminate some tradeoffs.}}

This paper generates provably collision free swarm behaviours by constructing swarm safety control barrier certificates. The safety barrier, implemented via an optimization-based controller, serves as a low level safety controller formally ensuring the forward invariance of the safe operating set. In addition, the proposed method naturally combines the goals of collision avoidance and interference with the coordination laws in a unified and computationally efficient manner. The centralized version of safety barrier certificate is designed on double integrator dynamic model, and then a decentralized formulation is proposed as a less computationally intensive and more scalable solution. The safety barrier certificate is validated in simulation and implemented experimentally on multiple mobile robots; the proposed optimization-based controller successfully generates collision free control commands with minimal overall impact on the coordination control laws.}}

Team VALOR, a Track A team, developed ESCHER leveraging and improving upon bipedal humanoid technologies implemented in previous research efforts, specifically for traversing uneven terrain and sustained untethered operation. This paper presents the hardware platform, software, and control systems developed to field ESCHER at the DRC Finals. ESCHER's unique features include custom linear series elastic actuators in both single and dual actuator configurations and a whole-body control framework supporting compliant locomotion across variable and shifting terrain. A high-level software system designed using the robot operating system integrated various open-source packages and interfaced with the existing whole-body motion controller. The paper discusses a detailed analysis of challenges encountered during the competition, along with lessons learned that are critical for transitioning research contributions to a fielded robot. Empirical data collected before, during, and after the DRC Finals validate ESCHER's performance in fielded environments.},

We propose a method that combines two basic techniques for motion generation: planning and optimization. The planning part is guided by a potential field function that grows a tree whose nodes are sets of possible contacts; the optimization part consists in a posture generator that checks the feasibility of contactsset candidates under constraints such as static stability, joint limits, non-desirable collisions, etc. The difference between successive nodes in the tree is exactly one contact (creation or removal). Our planner allows motion-supporting contacts to be made with any parts of each robot's links on any part of the environment: it can be seen as the generalization of motion in which walking is a particular case. Therefore, the meaning of obstacles is different from the classical usage in planning: any part of the environment is at the same time a potential support (for some parts of the robot) and an obstacle (for the remaining parts). We demonstrated our planner in various scenarios involving the HRP-2 humanoid robot and conducted several experiments.",

	ABSTRACT={OCRA stands for Optimization-based Control for Robotics Applications. It consists of a set of platform-independent libraries which facilitates the development of optimization-based controllers for articulated robots. Hierarchical, weighted, and hybrid control strategies can easily be implemented using these tools. The generic interfaces provided by OCRA allow different robots to use the exact same controllers. OCRA also allows users to specify high-level objectives via tasks. These tasks provide an intuitive way of generating complex behaviors and can be specified in XML format. To illustrate the use of OCRA, an implementation of interest to this research topic for the humanoid robot iCub is presented. OCRA stands for Optimization-based Control for Robotics Applications.

Our safety-first strategy worked: we avoided falling, and remote operators could safely recover from difficult situations. We were the only team in the DRC Finals that attempted all tasks, scored points (14/16), did not require physical human intervention (a reset), and did not fall in the two missions during the two days of tests.

	abstract = { The development of legged robots for complex environments requires controllers that guarantee both high tracking performance and compliance with the environment. More specifically the control of the contact interaction with the environment is of crucial importance to ensure stable, robust and safe motions. In this contribution we develop an inverse-dynamics controller for floating-base robots under contact constraints that can minimize any combination of linear and quadratic costs in the contact constraints and the commands. Our main result is the exact analytical derivation of the controller. Such a result is particularly relevant for legged robots as it allows us to use torque redundancy to directly optimize contact interactions. For example, given a desired locomotion behavior, we can guarantee the minimization of contact forces to reduce slipping on difficult terrains while ensuring high tracking performance of the desired motion. The main advantages of the controller are its simplicity, computational efficiency and robustness to model inaccuracies. We present detailed experimental results on simulated humanoid and quadruped robots as well as a real quadruped robot. The experiments demonstrate that the controller can greatly improve the robustness of locomotion of the robots.1}}

	abstract = {Humanoid robots rely on precise interaction force to locomote and perform various
	tasks. Controlling torque usually allows humanoid robots to produce these desired
	forces on known environments. However, the tracking may be imperfect in the absence
	of torque feedback or with an imprecise environment model. Furthermore, the presence
	of geometric errors, regarding the model of the environment, can also lead to discrepancies
	between desired and actual forces. In this paper, we extend our previous QP-based
	robust torque control framework to allow force control without requiring joint torque
	feedback. The control relies only on force/torque sensors at the end effectors, joint
	encoders and IMUs for kinematic feedback. Additionally, it is formulated to keep consistency
	with the internal state of the QP solver. We show that hybrid or parallel control,
	where position and force can be controlled independently, is possible with this approach.
	The framework is validated with stabilizer-free locomotion on uneven terrain and a
	multi-contact scenario with reference forces.},

	abstractNote={
	Control barrier function (CBF) based Quadratic Programs (QPs) were introduced in early 2014 as a means to guarantee safety in affine control systems in conjunction with stability/tracking. However, due to the presence of model-based terms, they fail to provide guarantees under model perturbations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new class of CBFs for robotic systems that augment kinetic energy with the traditional forms. We show that with torque limits permitting, and with the kinematic models accurately known, forward invariance of safe sets generated by kinematic constraints (position and velocity) can be guaranteed. The proposed methodology is motivated by the control Lyapunov function (CLF) based QPs that use the kinetic energy function. By the property of CBF-QPs, we show that the pointwise min-norm control laws obtained are feasible and Lipschitz continuous, and can be derived analytically via the KKT conditions. In order to include stability with safety, we also augment CLF based constraints in the CBF-QPs to realize a unified control law that allows tracking with safety irrespective of the inertial parameters of the robot. We will demonstrate the robustness of this class of CBF-QPs in two robotic platforms: a 1-DOF and a 2-DOF manipulator, by scaling the masses by up to 100, and then simulating the resulting dynamics.

Despite this success, model uncertainty remains a significant challenge in synthesizing safe controllers, leading to degradation in the properties provided by the controllers. This paper develops a machine learning framework utilizing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to reduce model uncertainty as it impact the safe behavior of a system. This approach iteratively collects data and updates a controller, ultimately achieving safe behavior. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally on a Segway platform.}}

	ABSTRACT={This paper proposes an online gain adaptation approach to enhance the robustness of whole-body control (WBC) framework for legged robots under unknown external force disturbances. Without properly accounting for external forces, the closed-loop control system incorporating WBC may become unstable, and therefore the desired task goals may not be achievable. To study the effects of external disturbances, we analyze the behavior of our current WBC framework via the use of both full-body and centroidal dynamics. In turn, we propose a way to adapt feedback gains for stabilizing the controlled system automatically. Based on model approximations and stability theory, we propose three conditions to ensure that the adjusted gains are suitable for stabilizing a robot under WBC. The proposed approach has four contributions. We make it possible to estimate the unknown disturbances without force/torque sensors. We then compute adaptive gains based on theoretic stability analysis incorporating the unknown forces at the joint actuation level. We demonstrate that the proposed method reduces task tracking errors under the effect of external forces on the robot. In addition, the proposed method is easy-to-use without further modifications of the controllers and task specifications. The resulting gain adaptation process is able to run in real-time. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our method both in simulations and experiments using the bipedal robot Draco2 and the humanoid robot Valkyrie.}}

	abstract = { State-dependent dynamical systems (DSs) offer adaptivity, reactivity, and robustness to perturbations in motion planning and physical human–robot interaction tasks. Learning DS-based motion plans from non-linear reference trajectories is an active research area in robotics. Most approaches focus on learning DSs that can (i) accurately mimic the demonstrated motion, while (ii) ensuring convergence to the target, i.e., they are globally asymptotically (or exponentially) stable. When subject to perturbations, a compliant robot guided with a DS will continue following the next integral curves of the DS towards the target. If the task requires the robot to track a specific reference trajectory, this approach will fail. To alleviate this shortcoming, we propose the locally active globally stable DS (LAGS-DS), a novel DS formulation that provides both global convergence and stiffness-like symmetric attraction behaviors around a reference trajectory in regions of the state space where trajectory tracking is important. This allows for a unified approach towards motion and impedance encoding in a single DS-based motion model, i.e., stiffness is embedded in the DS. To learn LAGS-DS from demonstrations we propose a learning strategy based on Bayesian non-parametric Gaussian mixture models, Gaussian processes, and a sequence of constrained optimization problems that ensure estimation of stable DS parameters via Lyapunov theory. We experimentally validated LAGS-DS on writing tasks with a KUKA LWR 4+ arm and on navigation and co-manipulation tasks with iCub humanoid robots. }}

Consequently, the problem of avoiding static and dynamic obstacles without human interference has gained a lot of attention. Avoiding collision, even in completely static environments, is significantly more challenging when the vehicle is subject to nonholonomic constraints. This paper presents a reactive algorithm for collision avoidance of dynamic, arbitrarily shaped obstacles, which is suitable for unicycle-type, nonholonomic vehicles. Unlike most reactive methods, we consider the exact shape of the obstacle, which allows the vehicle to utilize any space that is not occupied by the obstacle. This is an advantage over circle and ellipse approximations, as they can lead to overly conservative maneuvers. We provide explicit conditions under which collision avoidance is mathematically proven and validate the analysis by numerical simulations.}}

	ABSTRACT = {Model-based force control for motion and force tracking faces significant challenges on real quadruped platforms due to the apparent model inaccuracies. In this paper, we present a multi-objective optimal torque control for hydraulic quadruped robots under significant model errors, such as non-modelable hydraulic components, linearization, disturbances, etc. More specifically, the centroidal dynamics are first modeled to project the dynamics of the floating-based whole-body behaviors to the centroidal frame. Model error compensation mechanisms are subsequently developed to track the reference motion of the CoM, torso, and foot-end trajectories, which are mapped into the joint space. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimal torque control scheme is formulated using quadratic programming (QP) to coordinate follow the reference motion and ground reaction forces simultaneously while satisfying all constraints. Finally, we present a series of simulations as well as experiments on a real hydraulic quadruped platform, EHbot. The results demonstrate that the proposed torque control scheme is robust to large model inaccuracies and improves the performance of the overall system.},

This paper presents the first application of HZD to an underactuated lower-limb exoskeleton for gait guidance. A phase-based reference gait is generated to follow a nominal walking pattern. Simulation results using a phase-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller validate that stable periodic gait similar to nominal gait is possible for the identified human-exoskeleton model. For hardware application, a bilateral mixing strategy is taken to accommodate the presence of the double support phase which was assumed to be instantaneous in the hybrid model. A treadmill experiment is conducted with a healthy subject using the Indego Explorer exoskeleton. Comparing the recorded gait to the optimal phase-based reference, the root mean square joint tracking errors (RMSE) are 2.87°, 2.79°, 3.20°, and 11.0° at the stance hip, stance knee, swing hip, and swing knee, respectively. Similarly, compared to the commanded reference, the RMSE are 2.04°, 4.40°, 4.58°, and 6.83°, respectively. A second experiment was conducted wherein the treadmill speed varied from 0.3 to 0.5 m/s. The results show how the HZD controller exhibits remarkable flexibility and robustness for multiple walking speeds and grants the operator greater level of volitional control due to the time-invariant, phase-based nature of the implementation. Taken altogether, the presented results suggest that HZD control can serve as a rehabilitative control method capable of providing gait guidance in underactuated exoskeleton systems.}",

Billard and Kragic review the progress made in robotics to emulate these functions. Systems have developed from simple, pinching grippers operating in a fully defined environment, to robots that can identify, select, and manipulate objects from a random collection. Further developments are emerging from advances in computer vision, computer processing capabilities, and tactile materials that give feedback to the robot. Science, this issue p. eaat8414 Dexterous manipulation is one of the primary goals in robotics. Robots with this capability could sort and package objects, chop vegetables, and fold clothes. As robots come to work side by side with humans, they must also become human-aware. Over the past decade, research has made strides toward these goals. Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control. Open questions remain in terms of how to enable robots to deal with the most unpredictable agent of all, the human.}}

 	ABSTRACT={Modern scenarios in robotics involve human-robot collaboration or robot-robot cooperation in unstructured environments. In human-robot collaboration, the objective is to relieve humans from repetitive and wearing tasks. This is the case of a retail store, where the robot could help a clerk to refill a shelf or an elderly customer to pick an item from an uncomfortable location. In robot-robot cooperation, automated logistics scenarios, such as warehouses, distribution centers and supermarkets, often require repetitive and sequential pick and place tasks that can be executed more efficiently by exchanging objects between robots, provided that they are endowed with object handover ability. Use of a robot for passing objects is justified only if the handover operation is sufficiently intuitive for the involved humans, fluid and natural, with a speed comparable to that typical of a human-human object exchange. The approach proposed in this paper strongly relies on visual and haptic perception combined with suitable algorithms for controlling both robot motion, to allow the robot to adapt to human behavior, and grip force, to ensure a safe handover. The control strategy combines model-based reactive control methods with an event-driven state machine encoding a human-inspired behavior during a handover task, which involves both linear and torsional loads, without requiring explicit learning from human demonstration. Experiments in a supermarket-like environment with humans and robots communicating only through haptic cues demonstrate the relevance of force/tactile feedback in accomplishing handover operations in a collaborative task.}}

 	abstract="This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.",

 	abstract = {A handover is a complex collaboration, where actors coordinate in time and space to transfer control of an object. This coordination comprises two processes: the physical process of moving to get close enough to transfer the object, and the cognitive process of exchanging information to guide the transfer. Despite this complexity, we humans are capable of performing handovers seamlessly in a wide variety of situations, even when unexpected. This suggests a common procedure that guides all handover interactions. Our goal is to codify that procedure.To that end, we first study how people hand over objects to each other in order to understand their coordination process and the signals and cues that they use and observe with their partners. Based on these studies, we propose a coordination structure for human-robot handovers that considers the physical and social-cognitive aspects of the interaction separately. This handover structure describes how people approach, reach out their hands, and transfer objects while simultaneously coordinating the what, when, and where of handovers: to agree that the handover will happen (and with what object), to establish the timing of the handover, and to decide the configuration at which the handover will occur. We experimentally evaluate human-robot handover behaviors that exploit this structure and offer design implications for seamless human-robot handover interactions.},

The controller enables a robot to mimic human behavior by actively regulating the applied grip force according to the measured load force during a handover. We provide an implementation of the controller on a Willow Garage PR2 robot, demonstrating the feasibility of realizing our design on robots with basic sensor/actuator capabilities. A user study comparing four variations of our controller shows that our design yields both human-like and human-preferred object handovers.}}

For instance, robotic and telerobotic systems significantly reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission to frontline healthcare workers by making it possible to triage, evaluate, monitor, and treat patients from a safe distance. Various examples of where the medical, engineering, and science communities come together to aid the healthcare system, healthcare workers, and society during the current crisis are presented. The goal is to encourage an interdisciplinary dialog so that ethical, practical, and beneficial technological solutions are found to effectively tackle this and similar crises.},

 	abstract={This paper proposes an interaction learning method for collaborative and assistive robots based on movement primitives. The method allows for both action recognition and human--robot movement coordination. It uses imitation learning to construct a mixture model of human--robot interaction primitives. This probabilistic model allows the assistive trajectory of the robot to be inferred from human observations. The method is scalable in relation to the number of tasks and can learn nonlinear correlations between the trajectories that describe the human--robot interaction. We evaluated the method experimentally with a lightweight robot arm in a variety of assistive scenarios, including the coordinated handover of a bottle to a human, and the collaborative assembly of a toolbox. Potential applications of the method are personal caregiver robots, control of intelligent prosthetic devices, and robot coworkers in factories.},

 	abstract = { One step on the way to approach human performance in robotics is to provide joint torque sensing and control for better interaction capabilities with the environment, and a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) for improved versatility. However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its consistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey. }}

	abstract = {The effects of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market are matters of great social concern. Economists and technology experts are debating at what rate, and to what extent, technology could be used to replace humans in occupations, and what actions could mitigate the unemployment that would result. To this end, it is important to predict which jobs could be automated in the future and what workers could do to move to occupations at lower risk of automation. Here, we calculate the automation risk of almost 1000 existing occupations by quantitatively assessing to what extent robotics and AI abilities can replace human abilities required for those jobs. Furthermore, we introduce a method to find, for any occupation, alternatives that maximize the reduction in automation risk while minimizing the retraining effort. We apply the method to the U.S. workforce composition and show that it could substantially reduce the workers’ automation risk, while the associated retraining effort would be moderate. Governments could use the proposed method to evaluate the unemployment risk of their populations and to adjust educational policies. Robotics companies could use it as a tool to better understand market needs, and members of the public could use it to identify the easiest route to reposition themselves on the job market. Automation risk and resilience indices identify the easiest route to reposition workers who risk being replaced by robots.}}

	abstract = "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) has become a major trend in robotics in recent years with the idea of combining the strengths from both humans and robots. In order to share the work to be done, many task planning approaches have been implemented. However, they don{\textquoteright}t fully satisfy the required adaptability in human-robot collaborative tasks, as plans are often only generated for the robot, who adapts to the human independent activities; with most approaches not considering either the state of the human partner nor the possibility of adapting the collaborative plan during execution.In this paper, we present a planning system for human-robot collaborative plans that takes into account the agents' states and deals with unforeseen human behaviour, by replanning in anticipation when the human state changes to prevent action failure. The human state is defined in terms of capacity, knowledge and motivation. The system has been implemented in a standardized environment using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and the modular ROSPlan framework, and we have validated the approach in multiple simulation settings. Our results show that using the human model fosters an appropriate task allocation while allowing failure anticipation and replanning in time to prevent it.",

The contribution of the present work is to exploit redundancy to accomplish singularity avoidance and possibly recover the original PUMA design. The inverse for kinematics problem is solved at the velocity level by means of a closed-loop algorithm in the framework of task space augmentation with task priority. Three case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.}}

	abstract="If some resources of a robot are redundant with respect to a given objective, they can be used to address other, additional objectives. Since the amount of resources required to realize a given objective can vary, depending on the situation, this gives rise to a limited form of decision making, when assigning resources to different objectives according to the situation. Such decision making emerges in case of conflicts between objectives, and these conflicts appear to be situations of linear dependency and, ultimately, singularity of the solutions. Using an elementary model of a mobile manipulator robot with two degrees of freedom, we show how standard resolution schemes behave unexpectedly and inefficiently in such situations. We propose then as a remedy to introduce carefully tuned artificial conflicts, in the form of a trust region.",

Objective terms are used to control each feature, and are combined by a prioritization algorithm. We show how locomotion can be expressed in terms of a small number of features that control balance and end-effectors. This approach is used to build controllers for human balancing, standing jump, and walking. These controllers provide numerous benefits: human-like qualities such as arm-swing, heel-off, and hip-shoulder counter-rotation emerge automatically during walking; controllers are robust to changes in body parameters; control parameters and goals may be modified at run-time; control parameters apply to intuitive properties such as center-of-mass height; and controllers may be mapped onto entirely new bipeds with different topology and mass distribution, without modifications to the controller itself. No motion capture or off-line optimization process is used.},

High-order control barrier functions (HoCBFs) are firstly proposed for a nonlinear system with high relative-degree time-varying constraints. Then, the HoCBFs are introduced to impedance control for robotic manipulators, where the HoCBFs are employed to avoid the violation of time-varying output constraints in Cartesian space by quadratic program (QP), and the impedance control is designed to achieve compliance for human–robot interaction (HRI). In this way, the desired trajectory within the safety-critical region can be tracked without violating the output constraints due to the controller generated from QP, and the safe HRI can also be achieved because of the usage of impedance control method. Finally, simulation tests are conducted to verify the proposed control design methods.}}

When multiple CBFs are present, it is important that the set of controls satisfying all the barrier conditions is non-empty. In this paper, we investigate such a control-sharing property for multiple CBFs and provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the property to hold. Based on that, we study the tracking control design problem of an input–output linearizable system with multiple time-varying output constraints, where the output constraints are encoded as CBFs and the barrier conditions are expressed as hard constraints in a quadratic program (QP) whose feasibility is guaranteed by the control-sharing property of the CBFs. With the controller generated from the QP, the output constraints are always satisfied and the tracking objective is achieved when it is not conflicting with the constraints. The effectiveness of our control design method is illustrated by two examples.}}

This requires to think about possible use cases in order to make good predictions about the future of kinematic and dynamic models. While initially bipedal walking with its conceptual challenges was of large concern, more recently applications such as service robotics, disaster mitigation, elderly care, and medical robotics become more important. The chapter focuses on three respective future directions and argues that, first, novel concepts in mechatronics have to embrace modularity and failure tolerance and to focus on durability and endurance, concepts that may lead to a larger parameter variance in the mechanisms. Second, it is expected that real-time simulation will play a larger role and may even be included in the control loops while coupling elastic, hydraulic, or pneumatic elements with the multibody dynamics. Third, the chapter makes the prediction that the hybrid combination of data-driven and classical modeling will be key toward becoming more flexible and possibly including more soft elements also in humanoid robots. The chapter concludes with the prediction that the future of kinematic and dynamic modeling is to combine advances in classical rigid-body computations with soft mechatronics, real-time simulation, and a mix of fast computing of classical algorithms and learning methods.",

Yet controllers designed to provide robust safety guarantees often result in conservative behavior, and tuning these controllers to find the ideal trade-off between performance and safety typically requires domain expertise or a carefully constructed reward function. This work presents a design paradigm for systematically achieving behaviors that balance performance and robust safety by integrating safety-aware Preference-Based Learning (PBL) with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Fusing these concepts—safety-aware learning and safety-critical control—gives a robust means to achieve safe behaviors on complex robotic systems in practice. We demonstrate the capability of this design paradigm to achieve safe and performant perception-based autonomous operation of a quadrupedal robot both in simulation and experimentally on hardware.}}

	abstract = { The force distribution problem (FDP) in robotics requires the determination of multiple contact forces to match a desired net contact wrench. For the double support case encountered in humanoids, this problem is underspecified, and provides the opportunity to optimize desired foot centers of pressure (CoPs) and forces. In different contexts, we may seek CoPs and contact forces that optimize actuator effort or decrease the tendency for foot roll. In this work, we present two formulations of the FDP for humanoids in double support, and propose objective functions within a general framework to address the variety of competing requirements for the realization of balance. As a key feature, the framework is capable to optimize contact forces for motions on uneven terrain. Solutions for the formulations developed are obtained with a commercial nonlinear optimization package and through analytical approaches on a simplified problem. Results are shown for a highly dynamic whole-body humanoid reaching motion performed on even terrain and on a ramp. A convex formulation of the FDP provides real-time solutions with computation times of a few milliseconds. While the convex formulation does not include CoPs explicitly as optimization variables, a novel objective function is developed which penalizes foot CoP solutions that approach the foot boundaries. }}

As a consequence, human safety has become a dominant issue, together with production efficiency. In this paper we propose an optimization-based control algorithm that allows robots to avoid obstacles (like human operators) while minimizing the difference between the nominal acceleration input and the commanded one. Control Barrier Functions are exploited to build safety barriers around each robot link, to guarantee collision-free trajectories along the whole robot body. Human accelerations and velocities are computed by means of a bank of Kalman filters. To solve obstruction problems, two RGB-D cameras are used and the measured skeleton data are processed and merged using the mentioned bank of Kalman filters. The algorithm is implemented on an Universal Robots UR5 in order to validate the proposed approach.}}

These include walking to the vehicle, manually controlling its commands (e.g., ignition, gas pedal, and steering) and moving with the whole body to ingress/egress the car. We present a sensor-based reactive framework for realizing the central part of the complete task, consisting of driving the car along unknown roads. The proposed framework provides three driving strategies by which a human supervisor can teleoperate the car or give the robot full or partial control of the car. A visual servoing scheme uses features of the road image to provide the reference angle for the steering wheel to drive the car at the center of the road. Simultaneously, a Kalman filter merges optical flow and accelerometer measurements to estimate the car linear velocity and correspondingly compute the gas pedal command for driving at a desired speed. The steering wheel and gas pedal reference are sent to the robot control to achieve the driving task with the humanoid. We present results from a driving experience with a real car and the humanoid robot HRP-2Kai. Part of the framework has been used to perform the driving task at the DARPA Robotics Challenge.},

The approach employs quadratic optimization, and explicitly handles both joint position, velocity and acceleration limits. Contrary to existing techniques, our method does not rely on large safety margins and slow task execution to avoid joint limits, and is hence able to exploit the full potential of the robot. Furthermore, our control scheme guarantees a well-defined behavior of the robot even when it is in a singular configuration, and thus handles both internal and external singularities robustly. We demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our approach in a number of visual servoing applications, and compare it to a range of previously proposed techniques. }}

	(QP). Since constraints of the feature vector and the control
	input are considered when solving the optimal control problem,
	the control inputs can be bounded and the target can remain

Robots may be found in a wide variety of settings, performing a wide range of functions. These functions may be characterised in terms of whether the robot manipulates a tool or handles a workpiece. The human tasks associated with all robot installations are programming and maintenance. Other tasks vary depending on the particular robot application but are likely to fall into one of four categories. The use of robots has implications for safety and it is apparent that greater emphasis than hitherto must be laid on the design and implementation of procedures to ensure safety.}}

Numerous mobile robots in various forms specialize in either ground or aerial locomotion, whereas very few robots can perform complex locomotion tasks beyond simple walking and flying. We present the design and control of a multimodal locomotion robotic platform called LEONARDO, which bridges the gap between two different locomotion regimes of flying and walking using synchronized control of distributed electric thrusters and a pair of multijoint legs. By combining two distinct locomotion mechanisms, LEONARDO achieves complex maneuvers that require delicate balancing, such as walking on a slackline and skateboarding, which are challenging for existing bipedal robots. LEONARDO also demonstrates agile walking motions, interlaced with flying maneuvers to overcome obstacles using synchronized control of propellers and leg joints. The mechanical design and synchronized control strategy achieve a unique multimodal locomotion capability that could potentially enable robotic missions and operations that would be difficult for single-modal locomotion robots.}}

However, the lack of torque feedback information prevents the position-controlled humanoids from utilizing whole-body control directly, because it enhances the difficulty of guaranteeing desired contact force which is important for maintaining stability. In this paper, a whole-body control that integrates task-space inverse dynamics and variable contact force control is proposed for position-controlled humanoids to enhance the robot's adaptability toward the unknown disturbance. The task-space inverse dynamics generates the desired joint acceleration and contact force with the consideration of whole-body dynamics and other limits to track the references. The variable contact force control modifies references related to Center of Mass (CoM) and end effectors to ensure reasonable contact force tracking performance, thereby assuring good tracking performance of CoM and momentum to maintain robot stability. Simulations and experiments of balancing and walking under unknown disturbance have been successfully conducted on a position-controlled humanoid robot, BHR-7P3, with the proposed method.},

	locomotion machine. This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of
	a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with
	the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged
	locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback
	systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and
	versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some
	extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is
	added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and
	control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the
	resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand
	the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a
	wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique
	potential as research tools to investigate principles of
	biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and
	controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic
	research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged
	robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through
	open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in
	several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic
	leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures,
	i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while
	going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom

	manner, with little control and computational effort. For more
	versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint
	rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be
	included for feedback control with an open communication
	protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are
	designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It
	trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm), at a speed of 0.63
	m s-1 (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up
	to 10°, at 0.25 m s-1. The multi-body Webots model of Oncilla
	robot, and Oncilla robot's extensive software architecture
	enables users to design and test scenarios in simulation.
	Controllers can directly be transferred to the real robot.

While it is well understood in the literature that leg compliance plays an important role in running locomotion, our conjecture is that mechanically adjustable leg compliance improves the efficiency and robustness of a running system. We claim that variable compliance can serve as an effective means for gait regulation, and can enable energy efficient locomotion over a wide range of terrains and speeds. We draw inspiration from a number of observations in biomechanics, and use qualitative arguments and a simulation of our variable compliance actuator to support the underlying ideas.",

In particular, we characterize the existence and locations of possible equilibrium points of the closed-loop system and also provide analytical results on how design parameters affect them. Based on this analysis, a simple modification on the existing quadratic program-based controller is provided, which, without any assumptions other than those taken in the original program, inherits the safety set forward invariance property, and further guarantees the complete elimination of undesired equilibrium points in the interior of the safety set as well as one type of boundary equilibrium points, and local asymptotic stability of the origin. Numerical examples are given alongside the theoretical discussions.}}

This central role of the contact forces is widely recognized now, but it is rarely connected to the structure of the dynamics of articulated motion. Indeed, this dynamics is generally considered as a complex nonlinear black-box without any specific structure, or its structure is only partly uncovered. We propose here to precise this structure and show in details how it shapes the movements that an articulated system might realize. Some propositions are made then to improve the design of control laws for walking, running, jumping or free-floating motions.",

In this work, we propose a control architecture with a reference governor to enhance visual servoing with a predictive behavior, without giving up on the fast execution of the original reactive controller. The reference governor, implemented as a model predictive control, acts as an outer loop running at a relatively low frequency over the original visual servoing loop. This strategy takes advantage of the model prediction to improve the performance of the reactive controller and makes the whole structure more flexible. The proposed approach has been validated through simulations with a 7-axis robotic manipulator, a humanoid robot, and a hybrid wheeled-legged quadruped robot. Experiments on a real 7-axis manipulator show the validity of the approach in real-world scenarios.}}

	abstract = { Robots usually establish contacts at rigid surfaces with near-zero relative velocities. Otherwise, impact-induced energy propagates in the robot’s linkage and may cause irreversible damage to the hardware. Moreover, abrupt changes in task-space contact velocity and peak impact forces also result in abrupt changes in robot joint velocities and torques; which can compromise controllers’ stability, especially for those based on smooth models. In reality, several tasks would require establishing contact with moderately high velocity. We propose to enhance task-space multi-objective controllers formulated as a quadratic program to be resilient to frictional impacts in three dimensions. We devise new constraints and reformulate the usual ones to be robust to the abrupt joint state changes mentioned earlier. The impact event becomes a controlled process once the optimal control search space is aware of: (1) the hardware-affordable impact bounds and (2) analytically computed feasible set (polyhedra) that constrain post-impact critical states. Prior to and nearby the targeted contact spot, we assume, at each control cycle, that the impact will occur at the next iteration. This somewhat one-step preview makes our controller robust to impact time and location. To assess our approach, we experimented its resilience to moderate impacts with the Panda manipulator and achieved swift grabbing tasks with the HRP-4 humanoid robot. }}

	ABSTRACT = {Robots equipped with legs have significant potential for real-world applications. Many industries, including those concerned with instruction, aid, security, and surveillance, have shown interest in legged robots. However, these robots are typically incredibly complicated and expensive to purchase. Iron Dog Mini is a low-cost, easily replicated, and modular quadruped robot built for training, security, and surveillance. To keep the price low and its upkeep simple, we designed our quadruped robot in a modular manner. We provide a comparative study of robotic manufacturing cost between our proposed robot and previously established robots. We were able to create a compact femur and tibia structure with sufficient load-bearing capacity. To improve stability and motion efficiency, we considered the novel Watt six-bar linkage mechanism. Using the SolidWorks modeling software, we analyzed the structural integrity of the robot’s components, considering their respective material properties. Furthermore, our research involved developing URDF data for our quadruped robot based on its CAD model. Its gait trajectory is planned using a 14-point Bezier curve. We demonstrate the operation of the simulation model and briefly discuss the robot’s kinematics. Computational methods are emphasized in this research, coupled with the simulation of kinematic and dynamic performances and analytical/numerical modeling.},
